# STC Jawwy TV Data Analysis 

‏## Virtual Work Experience
‏During my virtual work experience with Skills Misk, I analyzed the data of the Jawwy TV application for STC. The focus was on understanding user behavior, building predictive models, and developing a recommendation system.

‏## Completed Tasks

‏### Task 1: User Behavior Analysis
‏- *Description:* Conducted a comprehensive analysis of user ratings data to understand user behaviors and preferences. Utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to identify trends and patterns in user interactions.

‏### Task 2: Predictive Modeling
‏- *Description:* Developed a predictive model to forecast total watching hours using time series analysis. Implemented a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX) model for accurate forecasting.

‏### Task 3: Machine Learning Recommendation System
‏- *Description:* Built a recommendation system using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, to provide personalized content suggestions based on user ratings.

‏### Task 4: Final Presentation
‏- *Description:* Prepared and delivered a presentation summarizing the analysis results, predictive model, and recommendation system. The presentation included visualizations to effectively communicate findings to the audience.

‏## Key Achievements
‏- *Comprehensive User Data Analysis:* Gained insights into viewer behaviors and preferences.
‏- *Accurate Predictive Model:* Developed a forecasting model that predicts future viewing hours with high accuracy.
‏- *Personalized Recommendations:* Implemented a recommendation system to enhance user experience through tailored suggestions.

‏## Technologies Used
‏- *Programming Language:* Python
‏- *Libraries Used:* 
‏  - *Pandas:* For data manipulation and analysis.
‏  - *NumPy:* For numerical computations.

‏  - *Plotly:* For interactive data visualization.

‏## Results and Insights
‏- *User Behavior Patterns:* Identified key trends that inform content strategy.
‏- *Forecasting Outcomes:* Generated forecasts that can assist in content planning and marketing efforts.
‏- *Effective Recommendations:* Enhanced user engagement through personalized content suggestions.

‏## Acknowledgments
‏I would like to thank Skills Misk for this opportunity and STC for providing the data that contributed to the success of this analysis.
