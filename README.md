# STC Jawwy TV Data Analysis

## Virtual Work Experience
During my virtual work experience with **#SkillsMisk**, I analyzed the data of the **#JawwyTV** application for **#STC**. The focus was on understanding user behavior, building predictive models, and developing a recommendation system.

## Completed Tasks
### Task 1: #UserBehaviorAnalysis
- **Description:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of user ratings data to understand user behaviors and preferences. Utilized exploratory data analysis techniques to identify trends and patterns in user interactions.

### Task 2: #PredictiveModeling
- **Description:** Developed a predictive model to forecast total watching hours using time series analysis. Implemented a **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (#SARIMAX)** model for accurate forecasting.

### Task 3: #MachineLearningRecommendationSystem
- **Description:** Built a recommendation system using machine learning techniques, specifically the **#KNearestNeighbors (#KNN)** algorithm, to provide personalized content suggestions based on user ratings.

### Task 4: #FinalPresentation
- **Description:** Prepared and delivered a presentation summarizing the analysis results, predictive model, and recommendation system. The presentation included visualizations to effectively communicate findings to the audience.

## Key Achievements
- **#ComprehensiveUserDataAnalysis:** Gained insights into viewer behaviors and preferences.
- **#AccuratePredictiveModel:** Developed a forecasting model that predicts future viewing hours with high accuracy.
- **#PersonalizedRecommendations:** Implemented a recommendation system to enhance user experience through tailored suggestions.

## Technologies Used
- **#ProgrammingLanguage:** Python
- **#LibrariesUsed:**
  - **#Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **#NumPy:** For numerical computations.
  - **#Plotly:** For interactive data visualization.

## Results and Insights
- **#UserBehaviorPatterns:** Identified key trends that inform content strategy.
- **#ForecastingOutcomes:** Generated forecasts that can assist in content planning and marketing efforts.
- **#EffectiveRecommendations:** Enhanced user engagement through personalized content suggestions.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank **#SkillsMisk** for this opportunity and **#STC** for providing the data that contributed to the success of this analysis.
